# New API Client (Recommended)

`bitmovin-dotnet` is the legacy Bitmovin API client for C#.

We recommend using the new client, which you can find at [bitmovin-api-sdk-dotnet](https://github.com/bitmovin/bitmovin-api-sdk-dotnet). Using the new client guarantees 100% specification conformity at any given time and access to all features of the API as soon as they are released.
